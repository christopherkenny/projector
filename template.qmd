An untitled slide?

Yes! It's possible with `---`.

## Callouts: Mapped from Beamer

We can use the heading values to control callouts, like so:

### Caution! {.alert}

This is an important warning.

### Try This {.example}

This demonstrates something useful.

### Note

Plain information.

## Callouts: Custom to this template

And here's a little extra flair

### Tip {.tip}

A tip for the viewer

### Note {.note}

A thing to note

### Warning! {.warning}

For a little less caution than an alert



## Using Typst functions
